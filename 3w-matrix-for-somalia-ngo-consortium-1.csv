Togdheer,Burao,Burco,13,1302,Health,Support for community education FGM project in Somaliland,International Solidarity Foundation (ISF),"SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT: 
This is a proposal for a project support for community education about Female Genital Mutilation and its multi-dimensional negative effective on women. The project is jointly prepared by Candlelight for Health, Education and Environment (CLHE) and the International Solidarity Foundation (ISF), in consultation with the project stakeholders, This proposal is also a product of a planning process that was begun in June 2010. It also builds up on the recommendations of the prior projects as well as the final self-evaluation study carried out in first phase of project 2010. 

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM), is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a range of procedures which involve Ôthe partial or complete removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or any other non-therapeutic reasonÕ. Among the Somalis, the overwhelming majority (98%) of women is genitally mutilated when they are 6-9 years old. The negative physical and psychological implications of FGM on girls and concern over the violation of basic human rights makes FGM a matter of pressing concern. At the same time the above mentioned socio-cultural analysis shows clearly that there is widespread low awareness among the community about FGM.

The persistent and the deep-rooted nature of the practice require a long term commitment to fight against FGM. Therefore, CHLE/ISF project on ÒSupport Community Education on FGM in SomalilandÓ is an extension of previous projects that CLHE and ISF have collaborated in their implementation (starting from 2007). This project will be part of a long process aimed at eventually leading to the abandonment of FGM practise and improved physical and psychological health of women in Togdheer and Sanaag regions. 

Enhancing community membersÕ awareness about the negative consequences of FGM in Togdheer and Sanaag is a key element of increasing womenÕs reproductive health. It is envisaged that when more community members become aware of the negative consequences of FGM less girls will be forced to undergo FGM. The project will result into more community awareness about FGM, more community health workers becoming aware of its hazards and at the same time challenging FGM as a religious obligation. This will be reached through among the community, capacity building and establishment of networking mechanism with the different stakeholders and finally collaborate with Burao and Erigavo hospitals to deal females with related to FGM impacts. The project will also respond to crucial training needs of project staff so that they can be able to address the FGM issue in an efficient and effective manner.",01-01-2011,12-01-2014

The current project enables these CBOs to increase and stabilize these incomes for their Community Development Funds through continued training and coaching from the PartnerAid training team. It enables these CBOs to further utilize these funds for community selected, owned, and managed health development projects and provides them with the training and coaching needed to manage and maintain these initiatives. 
In addition, the project increases local water access by partnering with CBOs to reconstruct water cisterns. To maximize the benefit of funds contributed and to ensure community ownership, PartnerAid will contribute resources for the reconstruction of up to 8 berkads and up to 4 shallow wells, with the communities contributing at least 50% of the resources.

1. Increased access to safe water for human consumption for 45,000 people, in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way, as well as sufficient water for other livelihoods purposes (domestic, agricultural, pastoral).
2. Increased and sustainable access to sanitation facilities for more than 21,000 people. 
Results 1 and 2 focus on the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities: seven boreholes, 50 wells, two springs, four mini-water systems, 40 roof catchments, 900 latrines and 120 refuse pits (for household, community or school). It takes up 41.3% and 18.5% of the budget respectively.
3. Increased hygiene awareness and proper use of water and sanitation facilities. It focuses on hygiene and sanitation promotion activities: community mobilisation and action planning through use of participatory approaches (PHAST and CHAST), public awareness campaigns and cleaning campaigns; for 16.4% of the budget. 
4.

Utilizing a comprehensive multi-sectoral strategy, the proposed project aims to bring about improvements in three areas: an increase in income of extremely poor and most vulnerable individuals within both returnee and receiving populations, an increase in the sources of skilled labour from the community for the community, and an increase in access to basic services across diverse sector areas of support. 

Through an innovative intensive skills-to-market approach, the present intervention will strengthen the livelihood asset base at the village level, combining basic literacy and classroom learning with practical hands-on, participatory learning in Cash For Work community-driven projects, directly boosting each target villageÕs capacity to provide basic services, such as infrastructure rehabilitation for both education and WASH, and community health and hygiene. The planned activities respond to migration challenges by increasing household income and food security levels. This is achieved by supporting the local market within the villages of return, expanding employment opportunities, community service projects and improving the diversity and quality of the skills-base of both returnees and receiving community members. Improved living and socio-economic conditions in the villages of origin contribute to a foundational level recovery strategy at this critical stage, building resilience and creating the basis to encourage future returns. Through the community-based participatory approach (CBPA), coping mechanisms will be improved at both the individual and community level, by linking the productive skills of the returnees to the needs of the community."
